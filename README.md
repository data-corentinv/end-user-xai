# EUCA: <ins>E</ins>nd-<ins>U</ins>ser-<ins>C</ins>entered Explainable <ins>A</ins>I Framework


The EUCA framework is a **prototyping tool** to design explainable artificial intelligence for non-technical end-users.

It can help you quickly build a low-fidelity explainable AI (XAI) prototype, and implement it as a functional one. 

You can use the prototype at the initial phase for user need assessment, and as a start for your explainable AI system iteration.

# Why explainable AI?


![When and why explainable AI for end-users](fig/why_xai.jpg)

As AI is getting pervasive and assists users in making decisions on **critical tasks**, such as autonomous driving vehicles, clinical diagnosis, financial decisions, legal and military judgment, or something crucial that relates to people's life or money, the end-users will be more likely to require AI to justify its prediction.

Making AI explainable to its end-users is challenging, since end-users are **laypersons** or **domain experts**, and they do not have technical knowledge in AI or computer science to understand how AI works.

# Who use EUCA?
EUCA can be used by **anyone who designs or builds** an explainable AI system **for end-users**, such as UI/UX designers, AI developers, AI researchers, and HCI researchers.

# What is the EUCA framework?

![The five main components of EUCA framework](fig/euca_compo.jpg)

The main component of EUCA is the **12 end-user-friendly explanatory forms**, and
- their associated design examples/templates
- corresponding algorithms for implementation, and 
- identified properties (their strength, weakness, UI/UX design implications, and applicable explanation needs) from our user study findings 
See **[explanatory forms page](explanatory_form.md)** for the above details and design examples.

In addition, EUCA also provides a [suggested prototyping method](#prototyping), and end-users' diverse **[explanation need analysis](need.md)** (such as to [calibrate trust](need.md/#trust), [detect bias](need.md/#bias), [resolve disagreement with AI](need.md/#unexpected)).

The 12 explanatory forms in EUCA framework are:
## [Feature-based explanation](explanatory_form.md/#feature)  
1. [Feature Attribute](explanatory_form.md/#fa)  
2. [Feature Shape](explanatory_form.md/#fs)  
3. [Feature Interaction](explanatory_form.md/#fi)  

## [Example-based explanation](explanatory_form.md/#example)  
4. [Similar Example](explanatory_form.md/#se)  
5. [Typical Example](explanatory_form.md/#te)  
6. [Counterfactual Example](explanatory_form.md/#ce)  

## [Rule-based explanation](explanatory_form.md/#rule)  
7. [Rule](explanatory_form.md/#rl)  
8. [Decision Tree](explanatory_form.md/#dt)  

## [Supplementary information](explanatory_form.md/#suppl)  
9. [Input](explanatory_form.md/#input)  
10. [Output](explanatory_form.md/#output)  
11. [Performance](explanatory_form.md/#perf)  
12. [Dataset](explanatory_form.md/#data)

# <a name="prototyping"></a> How to use EUCA for XAI prototyping?

![The five main components of EUCA framework](fig/euca_workflow.jpg)

## Step 1: Create prototyping cards from explanatory forms
1. Think about your input and feature data type

The input data and feature format need to be human-understandable, so that end-users can interpret the explanations which are formed by features, examples, or rules.

2. Get familiar with the [end-user-friendly explanatory forms](explanatory_form.md)  

3. Manually extracting several interpretable features

Given the AI task and input/output data type, the designer starts by manually extracting several interpretable features. 

For example, for tabular data, the features could be the column names that describing the input, such as house size, age, and location. 

For image data, the features could be saliency image part or object for recognition, such as cars, traffic signs, or pathological appearance of a disease on chest X-ray. 

As quick prototyping, the feature content may not necessarily reflect the true content generated by XAI algorithms. They served as content placeholders for the prototyping card design template.

4. Fill in the prototyping card template with the extracted features

Designer can use the **[prototyping card design templates](#template)**, and fill in the template with the above extracted features. In the design template and example, we provide the basic visualization of the explanatory forms used in the user study. Designers can also create their own template from scratch by referring to the design examples. 

5. (optional) Prepare variation cards on UI/UX

For a particular explanatory form, the designer may prepare multiple versions varying the visual representations (e.g.: graphics or text) and UI layout, alternating contents from brief to details, and providing different options, such as whether to use pre-defined or user-defined contrastive outcome on counterfactual example, whether to give users the option to set a threshold level for feature attribute, or refer to the UI/UX design implications part in the [end-user-friendly explanatory forms](explanatory_form.md). 

Each explanatory form and its variations are presented on individual prototyping cards.

6. (optional) Consider applying the general human-AI interaction guidelines

While designing UI/UX variations for the prototyping cards, designers may also consider and apply the general [human-AI interaction guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/Guidelines-for-Human-AI-Interaction-camera-ready.pdf), such as the following selected design guidelines that are more relevant to XAI system: 
- remember recent interactions
- support efficient invocation, dismissal and correction
- remember recent interactions
- learn from user behavior
- encourage granular feedback

## Step 2:  Get familiar with the end-user-friendly explanatory components 
There are 12 end-user-friendly explanatory types in the EUCA framework. They are grouped into four categories: explaining using features, examples, rules, and supplementary information. The explanatory types are building blocks, and you can combine them to construct your end-user-oriented XAI prototype.
The components in the EUCA framework are introduced [here](#framework).


## Step 3:  Create your explanatory component cards

Our [design templates](#template) contain the 12 explanatory components, each one is presented on a card. You can adopt the explanatory components to your task, and regarded them as individual components of your explainable AI prototype. 

For one explanatory component, you may prepare multiple versions varying its visual design, layout, the degree of details, etc. You may get more inspirations from the **design implication** part of each explanatory component. 


## Step 4: Talk to your end-users or other stakeholders, select and combine the explanatory components to construct your prototype
The EUCA framework can facilitate your participatory design process, i.e., to involve end-users or other stakeholders in the software development lifecycle. You can use the prepared explanatory component cards to discuss with your users about their needs for explainability. Sometimes the purposes to check explanations vary from calibrating trust with the AI system, to verifying the decisions from AI, to improving the predicted outcomes. And the demands for explainability may be distinct for different explanatory purposes. In your discussion, your users can select, combine, and arrange the explanatory cards to form a paper-based prototype that fulfills their needs under different purposes of checking explanations. 


## Step 5: Deploy and iterate the prototype
We list the corresponding algorithms after each explanatory component, so that you can implement them or use the existing open-sourced implementation to deploy your XAI prototype. You can iterate your XAI system based on the implemented working prototype.
